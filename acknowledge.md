# Acknowledgement

In your publications and presentations, please acknowledge the role that CofC's HPC resources have played in your research and teaching. We appreciate your conscientiousness in this matter. This information helps

* communicate the role HPC plays on campus teaching and research
* encourage more faculty, students and staff to incorporate HPC into their teaching and research
* justify CofC's investment in HPC
* ensure continued funding and support to keep HPC resources available and growing in the future

## Reporting Success Stories

Please alert our [IT communications department](mailto:drinkuthkh@cofc.edu) or [HPC team](mailto:hpc@cofc.edu) about papers and presentations that utilized CofC's HPC resources and personnel. Some of these success stories will be highlighted in IT's communication as well as other campus publications.

## Publications, Presentations, and Other Products

Any publications, presentations, websites, patents and other products resulting from work done on CofC HPC machines should include the following citation:

> "Computation for the work described in this product was supported by the College of Charlestonâ€™s High Performance Computing \(HPC\) resources \([https://hpc.cofc.edu](https://hpc.cofc.edu)\)."

Copies of published papers acknowledging HPC should be submitted for inclusion on the HPC project website, under the [publications page](products/publications.md) as well as the [CofC Research and Grants Administration Office](http://research.cofc.edu/administration/index.php). Be sure to include complete publication information \(i.e, a URL, PDF, or PS file of the actual publication\) and indicate if there are any restrictions on publication.

## Grants and Funding

If you are submitting proposals for grant funding with a computational component that can take advantage of our HPC resources, please contact our Research and Grants Administration Office [personnel](http://research.cofc.edu/administration/contact-orga-staff/index.php) and our [HPC team](mailto:hpc@cofc.edu) to discuss ways in which

* you can use our HPC resources in your research
* the presence of HPC resources can strengthen your proposals
* you can request funding to add to our HPC resources

If your project is supported by grants or other funding, this information should be included on the HPC project website under the [grants page](products/grants.md). This will be used internally to provide a better idea of how CofC researchers are making use of the HPC for funded projects.
