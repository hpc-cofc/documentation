# GUI - remote desktop

#### Graphical user interface \(GUI\)

GUIs enable users to compute on the cluster using little or no command line tools. These graphical access options come in two forms:

* Remote desktop sessions
* Web interface

**Remote desktop sessions**

We have a [Cendio Thinlinc ](https://www.cendio.com/)remote desktop server running on the cluster to provide users access to a graphical Linux environment. _We only have 5 concurrent licenses, so please close the remote desktop session and exit as soon as you are finished._ Users would need to download and install a Thinlinc Client from the [Cendio site](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download). There are Thinlinc Clients for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

After installing the Thinlinc Client, you can start the application and provide the necessary information to start the remote desktop session.

To ensure optimal usage without consuming a lot of resources on the client as well as server side, we recommend that you make the following changes to the under '**Options**'.

![If you have set up SSH keys, please choose &apos;public key&apos; authentication](../../.gitbook/assets/thinlinc-client-security-usesshkeys%20%281%29.png)

![Disable &apos;Full screen mode&apos;](../../.gitbook/assets/thinlinc-client-disable-fullscreen%20%281%29.png)

After you provide all the necessary information to log in, you will be asked to pick a 'Profile' or desktop manager. To prevent these remote desktop from taking too many resources in the login node, we suggest that you use a clean and lightweight desktop like XFCE.

Once you have picked a 'profile' or desktop manager, you should see a Linux remote desktop environment.

**Note:** _Because we only have 5 concurrent licenses, please close the remote desktop session and exit as soon as you are finished_
