# Mathematica

## Mathematica 12.0

Mathematica is a general symbolic and numerical simulation package that is known both for its powerful features and efficiency.

Here is a quick example of interactive serial and parallel calculations to print all Mersenne Prime numbers less than 5000. This example came from [UChicago](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/software/environments/mathematica/index.html)

While most people use Mathematica in interactive mode running on one CPU core, it does have capabilities to run on HPCs using a batch queue manager. We encourage users to do some testing on the login node and do their production runs by submitting them to compute nodes via the batch scheduler.

### What versions of Mathematica are available?

You can always execute `module spider matlab` to see what versions of Matlab are available. In our case, you should see something like this:

```text
user@localhost>  module spider mathematica

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  math/mathematica:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      Application for computational chemistry and biochemistry

     Versions:
        math/mathematica/12.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "math/matthematica" module (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  For example:

     $ module spider math/mathematica/12.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
