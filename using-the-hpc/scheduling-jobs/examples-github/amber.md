# AMBER

## AMBER 18

### Idea

This calculation simulates a 136475-atom biological molecule for 100,000 time steps \(0.2 nanoseconds\). It also reports how long of a simulation we can run in a day if we were to run it in

* one CPU-only node \(`one-node`\) with 40 cores = 40 MPI processes
* two CPU-only nodes \(`two-nodes`\) with 80 cores in total = 80 MPI processes
* one node with NVIDIA Quadro P4000 GPU \(`gpu-quadro-p4000`\) = 1 process on CPUs with massive processing on GPU
* one node with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU \(`gpu-tesla-v100`\) = 1 process on CPUs with massive processing on GPU

It demonstrates

* the power parallelization using MPI
  * compare calculations on a single node \(smp\) vs. multiple nodes \(mpi\)
* the power of GPUs
  * compare calculations on CPUs \(smp, mpi\) vs. GPUs \(p4000, v100\)
* different between consumer-grade and datacenter GPUs
  * compare consumer-grade \(NVidia Quadro P4000\) and datacenter \(NVIDIA Tesla V100\) GPU

### How to run

On the CofC HPC cluster, you can go into the `one-node`, `two-nodes`, `gpu-quadro-p4000` and `gpu-tesla-v100` directories and enter `sbatch run.slurm`

### Results

Here is a summary from a sample run.

| Calculation | Number of MPI processes | GPUs? | Speed of simulation \(ns/day\) \[higher is better\] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ./single-node/40.out: | 40 | - | 9.17 |
| ./two-nodes/80.out: | 80 | - | 14.49 |
| ./gpu-quadro-p4000/quadro.out: | 1 | 1 | 31.45 |
| ./gpu-tesla-v100/24.out: | 1 | 1 | 116.84 |
