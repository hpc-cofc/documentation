# Psi4

## Psi4Conda 1.3.1

Psi4 is a modular open-source suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed for efficient, high-accuracy simulations of a variety of molecular properties. It is very easy to use and has an optional Python interface. Learn more at [psicode.org](http://www.psicode.org)

Here is a quick example of SMP parallel Psi4 job that calculates the interaction energy of water dimer using the SAPT2+3\(CCD\) method.

There are other examples of Psi4Conda calculations at `/opt/ohpc/pub/apps/chem/psi4conda/1.3.1/share/psi4/samples`
