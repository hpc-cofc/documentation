# WebMO

[WebMO](https://www.webmo.net) is a web interface to many computational chemistry programs. It has many powerful capabilities
that give users access to computational chemistry tools without having to use a command line.

We have a WebMO Enterprise installation at [https://hpc.cofc.edu/webmo](https://hpc.cofc.edu/webmo).
To request an account, please
- email [hpc@cofc.edu](mailto:hpc@cofc.edu)
- submit a [service request](https://cofc.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=35085).

## Capabilities

### Visualization

Our [WebMO Enterprise](https://www.webmo.net/enterprise/index.html) installation has the following
capabilites:
- Build molecules by drawing atoms and bonds in a 3-D molecular editor, or by speaking the name (e.g., “aspirin”)
- Optimize structures using VSEPR theory or molecular mechanics
- View Huckel molecular orbitals, electron density, and electrostatic potential
- View point group and symmetry elements of molecules
- Lookup basic molecular information, including IUPAC and common names, stoichiometry, molar mass
- Lookup chemical data from PubChem and ChemSpider
- Lookup experimental and predicted molecular properties from external databases (NIST, Sigma-Aldrich)
- Lookup IR, UV-VIS, NMR, and mass spectra from external databases (NIST, NMRShiftDB)

### Interfaces to Common Packages
Our WebMO installation provides interfaces to the following packages:
- Gaussian,
- GAMESS, 
- ORCA
- MOPAC
- PSI

In the future, we will provide interface to these following packages based on the level of interest
and availability of the licenses for the packages.
- Molpro, NWChem, PQS, Quantum Espresso, VASP, Q-Chem, and Tinker

### Integration to Queue Manager
- Submit, monitor, and view calculations
- View formatted tabular data extracted from output files, as well as raw output
- Visualize geometry, partial charges, dipole moment, normal vibrational modes, molecular orbitals, and NMR/IR/UV-VIS spectra
