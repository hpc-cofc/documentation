# Working with Fortran

The tutorial assumes you have already worked through the [Execute a Job Tutorial](./). Therefore, the instructions here are abbreviated but will follow the same format so you may easily consult the extended tutorial.

üìù **Note:** Do not execute jobs on the login nodes; only use the login nodes to access your compute nodes. Processor-intensive, memory-intensive, or otherwise disruptive processes running on login nodes will be killed without warning.

## Step 1: Access Your Allocation

If you need to request an allocation, see [instructions here](../request-access.md).

1. Open a Bash terminal \(or PuTTY for Windows users\).
2. Execute `ssh username@or-condo-login.univ.edu`.
   * Replace "username" with your  or  ID.
3. When prompted, enter your  or  password.

## Step 2: Create a PBS Script

### Example PBS Script

Here is an example PBS script for running a batch job on a HPC Condo allocation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#PBS -N mpi_hello_world_f
#PBS -M your_email@univ.edu
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
#PBS -l walltime=0:00:6:0
#PBS -W group_list=cad-right
#PBS -A right
#PBS -l qos=burst
#PBS -V

module purge
module load PE-gnu
module list
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
pwd
mpirun hello_world_f
```

### PBS Procedure

1. From the login node, change your working directory to the desired file system. We are going to use our Lustre allocation for this example. _If Lustre storage is not available, you may complete this tutorial from within your home directory on NFS._

   ```bash
   cd /lustre/or-myst/cad-right/username
   ```

   Replace "username" with your / user ID.

2. Use Vi to create and edit your PBS script.

   ```bash
   vi hello_world_f.pbs
   ```

3. Create your PBS script within Vi or paste the contents of your PBS script into Vi.
4. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.

## Step 3: Compile the Fortran Program from Source

### MPI Hello World Source Code

```text
program helloworld
use mpi
integer ierr, numprocs, procid

call MPI_INIT(ierr)

call MPI_COMM_RANK(MPI_COMM_WORLD, procid, ierr)
call MPI_COMM_SIZE(MPI_COMM_WORLD, numprocs, ierr)

print *, "Hello world! I am process ", procid, "out of", numprocs, "!"

call MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)

stop
end
```

### Fortran Procedure

1. Ensure that you are still in your working directory \(`/lustre/or-myst/cad-right/username`\) using `pwd`.
2. Use Vi \(`vi`\) to create your Fortran source file within your working directory.

   ```bash
   vi hello_world.f90
   ```

3. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.
4. Load the MPI compiler using the PE-gnu module.

   ```bash
   module load PE-gnu
   ```

5. Compile the Fortran source into a binary executable file.

   ```bash
   mpifort -o hello_world_f hello_world.f90
   ```

6. Use `ls -al` to verify the presence of the `hello_world_f` binary in your working directory.

## Step 4: Run the Job

1. Before proceeding, ensure that you are still in your working directory \(using `pwd`\) and that you still have the PE-gnu module loaded \(using `module list`\).
   * We need to be in the same path/directory as our PBS script and our Fortran binary. Use `ls -al` to confirm their presence.
   * PE-gnu also loads OpenMPI, GCC, and XALT. Use `module list` to confirm their presence. If necessary, use `module load PE-gnu` to reload the module\(s\).
2. Use `qsub` to schedule your batch job in the queue.

   ```bash
   qsub hello_world_f.pbs
   ```

   This command will automatically queue your job using Torque and produce a six-digit job number \(shown below\).  


   ```bash
   143295.or-condo-pbs01
   ```

   You can check the status of your job at any time with the `checkjob` command.

   ```bash
   checkjob 143295
   ```

   You can also stop your job at any time with the `qdel` command.

   ```bash
   qdel 143295
   ```

3. View your results.  
    You can view the contents of these files using the `more` command followed by the file name.  


   ```bash
   more mpi_hello_world_f.o143295
   ```

   Your output should look something like this \(_the output is truncated._\):

   ```bash
   Hello world! I am process            3 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            0 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            1 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            7 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            8 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            2 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process            6 out of          20 !
   Hello world! I am process           11 out of          20 !
   .
   .
   .
   ```

4. Download your results \(using the `scp` command or an SFTP client\) or move them to persistent storage.
