# Working with Makefiles

The tutorial assumes you have already worked through the [Execute a Job Tutorial](./). Therefore, the instructions here are abbreviated but will follow the same format so you may easily consult the extended tutorial.

On this page, we will use a Makefile to automate the compiling of the C, C++, and Fortran programs. In our PBS script, we will send a command to the Makefile which will compile codes prior to submitting the job to MPI.

üìù **Note:** Do not execute jobs on the login nodes; only use the login nodes to access your compute nodes. Processor-intensive, memory-intensive, or otherwise disruptive processes running on login nodes will be killed without warning.

## Step 1: Access Your Allocation

If you need to request an allocation, see [instructions here](../request-access.md).

1. Open a Bash terminal \(or PuTTY for Windows users\).
2. Execute `ssh username@login.univ.edu`.
3. When prompted, enter your password.

## Step 2: Create a PBS Script

### Example PBS Script

Here is an example PBS script for running a batch job on a HPC Condo allocation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#PBS -N mpi_hello_world_make
#PBS -M your_email@univ.edu
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
#PBS -l walltime=0:00:6:0
#PBS -W group_list=right
#PBS -A right
#PBS -l qos=burst
#PBS -V

module purge
module load PE-gnu
module load python
module list
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
pwd

make all

echo "=================================="
echo "Output of the MPI and C program"
echo "=================================="

mpirun hello_world_c

echo "=================================="
echo "Output of the MPI and C++ program"
echo "==================================="

mpirun hello_world_cpp

echo "====================================="
echo "Output of the MPI and Fortran program"
echo "====================================="

mpirun hello_world_f

echo "====================================="
echo "Output of the MPI and Python program"
echo "====================================="

mpirun python hello_world.py

echo "============================="
echo "Successful!!!... End of File"
echo "============================="
```

### PBS Procedure

1. From the login node, change your working directory to the desired file system. We are going to use our Lustre allocation for this example. _If Lustre storage is not available, you may complete this tutorial from within your home directory on NFS._

   ```bash
   cd /lustre/myst/right/username
   ```

   Replace "username" with your / user ID.

2. Use Vi to create and edit your PBS script.

   ```bash
   vi hello_world_make.pbs
   ```

3. Create your PBS script within Vi or paste the contents of your PBS script into Vi.
4. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.

## Step 3: Create the Makefile

A makefile contains instructions for Make software to automate the build of programs and source codes.

### Makefile Code

This file must be located in the same path as the other source programs.

```text
CC = mpicc
CXX = mpic++
FC = mpifort

OPTFLAGS = -O3
CFLAGS = $(OPTFLAGS) -g
CXXFLAGS = $(OPTFLAGS) -g
FFLAGS = $(OPTFLAGS) -g

all:hello_world_c hello_world_cpp hello_world_f

hello_world_c: hello_world.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o hello_world_c hello_world.c

hello_world_cpp: hello_world.cpp
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o hello_world_cpp hello_world.cpp

hello_world_f: hello_world.f90
        $(FC)  $(FFLAGS) -o hello_world_f hello_world.f90

clean:
        rm hello_world_*
```

üìù **Note:** Indentations in a Makefile must be a `Tab` and not `spaces`.

### Makefile Procedure

1. Ensure that you are still in your working directory \(`/lustre/myst/right/username`\) using `pwd`.
2. Use Vi \(`vi`\) to create your Makefile within your working directory.

   ```bash
   vi Makefile
   ```

3. Paste the hello world Makefile code into Vi.
4. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.

_If you have been following along the cad tutorials in order, you will already have compiled programs for C, C++, and Fortran. However, if you did not already have compiled codes, the Makefile we have created here would compile all of them when we run our PBS script. In the_ `hello_world_make.pbs` _file, there is a line that says_ `make all`_. This command will run the contents of our Makefile, which will compile the C, C++, and Fortran programs prior to running the job._

## Step 4: Run the Job

1. Before proceeding, ensure that you are still in your working directory \(using `pwd`\) and that you still have the PE-gnu and python/3.6.1 modules loaded \(using `module list`\).
   * We need to be in the same path/directory as our PBS script and our Makefile. Use `ls -al` to confirm their presence.
2. Use `qsub` to schedule your batch job in the queue.

   ```bash
   qsub hello_world_make.pbs
   ```

   This command will automatically queue your job using Torque and produce a six-digit job number \(shown below\).  


   ```bash
   143295.or-condo-pbs01
   ```

   You can check the status of your job at any time with the `checkjob` command.

   ```bash
   checkjob 143295
   ```

   You can also stop your job at any time with the `qdel` command.

   ```bash
   qdel 143295
   ```

3. View your results.  
    You can view the contents of these files using the `more` command followed by the file name.  


   ```bash
   more mpi_hello_world_make.o143295
   ```

   Your output should look something like this \(_the output is truncated._\):

   ```bash
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=9  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=4  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=0  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=1  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=3  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=5  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=2  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=6  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=7  Hello world
   Processor or-condo-c229.univ.edu ID=8  Hello world
   .
   .
   .
   ```

4. Download your results \(using the `scp` command or an SFTP client\) or move them to persistent storage.
