# Prerequisites

To properly utilize HPC Condos, you will need a couple of utilities loaded on your local machine. These utilities are free and widely used for this type of application.

* Required: **SSH client**
* Recommended: **Bash terminal**

## MacOS and Linux

Both macOS and Linux distributions include a Bash terminal and an SSH client by default. No additional software should be required to access HPC Condos.

## Windows Users

Word is Windows 10 has a Bash shell. Yay!! If you are using an older version of Windows, you have the following options, among others for sure.

* [MobaTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)
* [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - SSH client and Bash environment for Windows.
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) – Part of the Git for Windows environment includes Git Bash, which provides a light weight ssh client.
* [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) – If you wish to have Bash-style functions on your Windows machine, then you should consider installing Cygwin, which ports the Portable Operating System Interface \(POSIX\) system calls and environment to Windows.
