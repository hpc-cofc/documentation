# Visualize Data

## SUMMARY

### The Data

Data produced from your calculations comes in many different forms such as [\[1\]](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/presentations/images-and-pdfs/SCIVisHPC.pdf)

* Typically continuous fields –
  * Scalar, vector, tensor –2D, 3D, 2.5D 
* Geometry \(“topology”\) 
  * Structured \(finite differences\) –
  * Unstructured 
    * Tet, hex meshes \(finite elements\) 
    * Particles -- n-body simulations \(molecular dynamics, cosmology, blood flow\) 
    * AMR
  * Other \(spectral / functional / wavelet\) •
    * DFT, FMM, DNS 
    * Usually generate large structured data as postprocess

### The Visualizations 

This data can be visualized as 

* Linear or curved scalar plots
* Pseudocolors
* Isocontours
* Isosurfaces
* Volume renderings
* Vector flows
* Molecular visualizations

### The Tools enabling data Visualization

There are a lot of software that are specifically designed for research computing platforms. That means the ability to handle remote visualization, do parallel processing of data, recognize parallel data formats and render graphics remotely or locally. Here is a list of the most common ones:

* [VTK](http://www.vtk.org)
* [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org)
* [VisIT](http://visit.llnl.gov)
* [VisUS](https://wiki.visus.org/index.php/ViSUS_Viewer)
