        <p><b>P. Chris Fragile (Physics and Astronomy) - </b><a href="http://fragilep.people.cofc.edu/"><b>http://fragilep.people.cofc.edu/</b></a>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Prof. Fragile is a computational astrophysicist studying the formation
          of black holes and how different particles flow near them. The necessary
          simulations are so demanding that even the world&#x2019;s fastest computers
          can run them to fully. Prof. Fragile develops a computer code called Cosmos
          to make these simulations faster and more tractable. He uses local HPC
          resources to run test simulations and train students about software development
          before performing the most demanding simulations at some of the world&#x2019;s
          most powerful HPCs at different government labs. Some of his efforts have
          been profiled here:

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Prof. Strand is an evolutionary biologist using advanced statistical methods
          to study how populations and genes change over time. The gene sequence
          data takes a lot of storage and analyzing the data requires a lot of processing
          power. Therefore, his workload is ideal for HPC clusters and he is already
          utilizing Open Science Grid (OSF) to run his simulations. In addition,
          he has an NSF grant to develop software for doing the kinds of population
          genetics on HPC environments.</p>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Prof. Sotka is a marine biologist studying the population genetics and
          conservation of marine species. Among his many projects, one is a current
          collaboration with Prof. Allan Strand examining the genetic history of
          an important oyster parasite called MSX. These genetic simulations are
          both time and resource intensive, therefore they are perfectly suited to
          run on our HPC cluster.</p>

        <p><b>Anthony Bishara (Psychology) - </b><a href="https://blogs.cofc.edu/bisharaa/"><b>https://blogs.cofc.edu/bisharaa/</b><br /><br /></a>Dr.
          Bishara uses statistical tools to assess the validity of assumptions that
          scientists in psychology and beyond in deriving conclusions from their
          data. The certainty with which he can make these assessments depends on
          the size of the data he can analyze. Therefore, being able to use an HPC
          system with large storage, memory and processing power will enable and
          catalyze his research. He is already using the current campus cluster to
          run some of his analysis code.</p>

          Krantzman is a computational chemist simulating the bombardment of solid
          surfaces with different projectiles including the C60 buckyball, and reactions
          that occur at the interface between gases and solids. The molecular dynamics
          simulations needed to understand these collision/fragmentation phenomenon
          are computationally intensive and they invariably require HPC clusters
          to run.</p>

          Mitchener is an applied mathematician who develops models that are applied
          to linguistics and biology. Some of his models are optimized to run on
          HPC clusters and he has used computing resources at Clemson for his research.</p>

          Williams is an atmospheric physicist studying the formation, intensification
          and weakening of tropical cyclones like hurricanes and typhoons. He analyzes
          data collected by weather aircrafts and runs fluid dynamics simulations
          to get a better understanding of tropical cyclones. Computational fluid
          dynamics (CFD) is one of the most common problems employed on HPC clusters
          due to its computational demands. Dr. Williams is profiled here:

        <p><b>Ana Uribe (Physics and Astronomy) -</b>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Prof. Ana Uribe studies the evolution of planetary system by simulating
          how newly forming planets interact with their parent star. Her group calculates
          the rate of migration of a nascent planet toward its parent star and how
          that rate varies depending on the gas density and the nature of the surrounding
          material. HPC can enable and accelerate more of Prof. Uribe&#x2019;s research.</p>
