# Projects utilizing CofC HPC resources

## Purpose
If you are submitting proposals for grant funding with a computational component that can take advantage of our HPC resources, please contact our Research and Grants Administration Office [personnel](http://research.cofc.edu/administration/contact-orga-staff/index.php) and our [HPC team](mailto:hpc@cofc.edu) to discuss ways in which
* you can use our HPC resources in your research
* the presence of HPC resources can strengthen your proposals
* you can request funding to add to our HPC resources

If your project is supported by grants or other funding, this information should be included on the HPC project website under the [grants page](grants.md). This will be used internally to provide a better idea of how CofC researchers are making use of the HPC for funded projects.
