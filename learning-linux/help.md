# Help

## Man pages
Most Linux commands and utilities have well-maintained help/manual pages that you can invoke by entering <code>man 'command'</code> for any given <code>'command'</code>.

## tldr

However, these thorough man pages can sometimes be overwhelming and verbose. Thankfully,
<code>tldr</code> is there to give you the most concise and practical uses of these commands and
utilities.  <code>tldr<code> is a simplified and community-driven man page for the masses.

<code>tldr</code> is installed on the CofC cluster, but you can install it in your local environment.
