# Help - man/tl;dr

## Man pages

Most Linux commands and utilities have well-maintained help/manual pages that you can invoke by entering `man 'command'` for any given `'command'`.

## tldr

However, these thorough man pages can sometimes be overwhelming and verbose. Thankfully, `tldr` is there to give you the most concise and practical uses of these commands and utilities. tldr is a simplified and community-driven man page for the masses.

`tldr` is installed on the CofC cluster, but you can install it in your local environment.
