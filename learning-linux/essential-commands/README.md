## Overview

* Linux has a hierarchy of directories that lists contents of files in a tree-like format, starting from the file system root \(`/`\).
* Linux is _case-sensitive_, e.g. `Myfile`, `myfile`, `MYFILE`, and `MyFile` are four unique files.
* Linux does not require filename extensions such as `.doc`, `.exe`, and `.abc`. The `.` extension is simply part of the filename. Sometimes data files are named with extensions \(.hdf, .cdf, .tar\) for human readability, though this is optional.
* A file named with `.` at the beginning will be considered a hidden file.
* You can use the `<TAB>` key to autocomplete commands, paths, and environment variables. For example, you can type `cal` on your terminal followed by `<TAB>` to test this. If there is more than one option for the autocomplete to choose from, pressing `<TAB>` _twice_ will provide a list of all possible options based on what you have typed.
* The `up-arrow` will display the previous command you have typed and if you press the `down-arrow`, it will refer to the following command.
* The `history` command will show all of the previous commands you have entered during the last session\(s\).

## Basic Commands

* **pwd: Print Current Working Directory**

  ```bash
  pwd
  /Users/x0y
  ```

  _The output of_ `pwd` _in this case, is the home directory of the user x0y, which is shown with the complete path starting from root\(_`/`_\)_

* **ls: List the contents of the current directory**

  ```bash
  ls
  Documents/   Pictures/   Desktop/   Downloads/   document.txt
  ```

  _The output is a list of four directories \(followed by a_ `/`_\) and one file. To see information about the contents in a list, type_ `ls -l`_._

* **cd: Change directory**

  ```bash
  cd Documents
  ```

  _In this case, we are entering the "Documents" directory._

  If you want to go directly to your home directory \(x0y\), you can type `cd` without any specification of which directory.

  In the case of nested folders, you can jump one directory level upwards by typing `cd ..`

  **alias**: In case of deeply nested folders \(/path/to/project/com/java/lang/morefiles\) that might take more than 4 directory levels upwards, you can create an `alias`, for example, `alias ..2="cd ../.."` or `alias ..3="cd ../../.."` or `alias ..4="cd ../../../.."`. If you wish to make these aliases a permanent feature of your Bash environment, you may add the commands to the end of the `.bashrc` file. Edit the `.bashrc` file by opening it in your favorite text editor \(it is located in your home directory\). For example, type `vi .bashrc`.

* **whoami: Shows the user ID as a name**

  ```bash
  whoami
  x0y
  ```

  _This shows the username that is logged in to the current session of the machine._

  If you need additional information about the user, such as, to which groups they are a member, type `id`.

  If you want to see all the users that are logged in to the computer, you can type `w`.

* **date: Display the date and time of the system**

  ```bash
  date
  Wed Apr  4 09:06:30 EDT 2018
  ```

  _The date is shown in a complex format._ Use `date +%F` format if you want to do a [backup of a file including the date in the filename](../bash-scriptingbackup.md).

  If you want to [calculate, in seconds, the duration of a program](../bash-scripting/seconds.md), you can use the `date +%s` command.

* **cal: Display a calendar of the current month**

  ```bash
  cal
  ```

  _This command displays the calendar of the current month of the year in which the command is executed._

  In case you need the whole year calendar of 2018, you may type `cal 2018` or set any other year you want to check.

  If you want to display any particular month of the year, you can type, for example, `cal March 2018`.

  To display the Eastern date of the current year, please type `ncal -o`.

* **cat: Creates a single or multiple files, views the contents of a file, concatenates files, and redirects output into the terminal or into files**

  ```bash
  cat /Users/x0y/myfile.txt
  hello world
  ```

  _In this case, we want to display the content of_ `myfile.txt` _which is located inside the_ `x0y` _directory._

  If we are positioned inside the `x0y` directory, all that is needed is `cat myfile.txt` to see its contents, which is "hello world".

  You can view the content of two files at the same time with the `cat file1.txt file2.txt`.

  In case you need the lines of a text numbered, please type `cat -n myfile.txt`.

* **echo: Display a line of text or a string on standard output or into a file**

  ```bash
  echo "Hi Univ"
  Hi Univ
  ```

  _In this example, the string_ `Hi Univ` _is shown because we send that message to the terminal._

  To view the value assigned to a variable, add `$` before the variable name:

  \(e.g. `x=10; echo "The value of 'x' is: $x"`\).

  If you need a new line `\n`, use the option `-e` \(e.g. `echo -e "Hello \n world"`\).

* **touch: Create a new empty file**

  ```bash
  touch myNEWfile
  ```

  _In this case,_ `myNEWfile` _was created inside the directory in which you are positioned._

  You can create more than one file at the same time with by typing `touch file1 file2`.

  If you want to create lots of files that share a common string, e.g. `test1.txt`, `test2.txt`, `test3.txt`, and so on until 25, you can use `touch test{1..25}.txt`.

* **mkdir: make directory**

  ```bash
  mkdir myNEWdir
  ```

  _In this case, a new directory called_ `myNEWdir` _is created in the current path._

  If you want to set the permission of the directory while you are creating the directory, you can do so by typing `mkdir -m a=rwx myNEWdir`. Here, the letters r, w, and x stand for read, write, and execute, respectively. For more information on file and directory permissions, see [here](../managing-files/file-permissions.md).

  If you want to create multiple directories at once, run `mkdir test1 test2 test3`.

  If you want to create several subdirectories at one time, type `mkdir -p /home/test/test1/test2/test3/test4`.

* **cp: Copy files and directories**

  ```bash
  cp /path/to/file_src /path/to/file_dest
  ```

  In this case the contents of `file_src` \(source\) will be copied to `file_dest` \(destination\) and both files will be present in both paths.

  If you need to copy more than one file into a directory, you can type `cp main.c def.h /Users/x0y/mydir/`.

  To copy all the files you have \(in your current path\) with the extension `.c` to a directory called `bak`, you can type `cp *.c bak`. The asterisk \(`*`\) is a wild-card character.

* **mv: Move or rename the files or directories**

  ```bash
  mv file1 Myfile1
  ```

  _The file called_ `file1` _was renamed as_ `Myfile1`_._

  If you want to move all of your C files to a subdirectory called `bak`, you can run `mv *.c bak`.

  If you want to create a backup when copying your `.txt` files into the `mybak` directory \(to not overwrite existing files within `mybak`\) use: `mv -bv *.txt /Users/x0y/mybak`.

* **rm: Delete files or directories**

  ```bash
  rm file1 Myfile1
  ```

  _The files called_ `file1` _and_ `Myfile1` _will be removed._

  For directories, the recursive option `-r` is needed, e.g. `rm -r modelOutput`.

* **man: Display the manual of the Linux commands**

  ```bash
  man sudo
  ```

  _A manual related to the_ `sudo` _command is displayed explaining how the_ `sudo` _command will grant you privileges to execute commands as the superuser does._

  For further information you can do `man man` to read more about `man`. To exit a manual page, type `q`.

## Pipe and Redirection

* **\|  Pipeline**

  A _pipe_ is a form of redirection that sends the output of a program \(written _before the pipe_\) to another one \(written _after the pipe_\) for further processing.

  To make a pipe, put a vertical bar \(`|`\) on the command line between two commands.

  ```bash
  man pipe | cat > /tmp/myMAN.txt
  ```

  _The command_ `man pipe` _will display the content of all the information about **pipe**, then **that content** will be processed by_ `cat` _\(taken as its **input**\) and be redirected to the file_ `/tmp/myMAN.txt`_. So, the **output**, the content of_ `myMAN.txt` _will display the manual information about **pipe**._

* **&gt;  Redirecting output**

  Commands can send and receive streams of data to and from files and devices.

  ```bash
  echo "Test report title" > /tmp/test.txt
  ```

  _"Test report title" will be written to the file_ `test.txt` _located inside the_ `/tmp` _directory._

  It is also possible to send all the content of `/tmp/hi.txt` to `/Users/x0y/hello`, by using `/tmp/hi.txt > /Users/x0y/hello`.

  `Mail -s "Subject" to-address@example.com < Filename` will email the content of `Filename`.

* **&gt;&gt;  Appending \(postpending\) redirected output**

  This command will append \(postpend\) information to where it is designated.

  ```bash
  echo "This report was done at $HOSTNAME at $(date+%F)">>/tmp/report.txt
  ```

  _The output of the first part of the command \(before the_ `>>`_\) will be added at the **end** of the file_ `/tmp/report.txt`_._
