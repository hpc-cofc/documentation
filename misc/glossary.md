# Glossary

## Glossary

For other terms commonly used in research software engineering environments, please see the [USRSE glossary](https://github.com/rseng/rse-glossary/blob/master/_data/terms.yml)

### Terms

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bash | A UNIX shell used for entering command-line executions. Included with most Linux distributions and macOS. Includes SSH capability. |
| Cluster | Servers, networked to execute batch jobs that require high core count, not possible on a single physical server |
| Hypervisor | Also known as a _virtual machine monitor_, a hypervisor is software/hardware that creates, runs, and manages virtual machines. |
| Instance | A virtual machine set up through OpenStack. See "Virtual Machine". |
| OpenStack | A cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. |
| Project | The base unit of "ownership" in OpenStack. All resources in OpenStack should be owned by a specific project. In OpenStack Identity, a project must be owned by a specific domain. |
| Scheduler | Software responsible for the job, queue, and user management and accounting, e.g. Slurm |
| Virtual Machine | An operating system instance that runs on top of a hypervisor. Multiple virtual machines \(VMs\) can run at the same time on the same physical host. |

| PEARC | The Practice and Advanced Experience in Research Computing Conference series \(pronounced 'perk'\). [https://www.pearc.org/](https://www.pearc.org/) |
| version control | a system that lets you keep every version of a file, in the case that you need to restore it later. Common version control online services like GitHub or GitLab provide you with a remote repository to interact with using git.  [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) |
| code reviews | the practice of looking over other's code for possible bugs and improvements, and to ensure that work done is in scope with goals for the project. Code reviews are typically done by way of version control platforms when one person wants to merge their changes with the main project branch. This is called a 'pull request' on GitHub. [https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/) |
| continuous integration \(ci\) | the process of continually and regularly testing, building, and deploying your code to ensure that bugs don't pop up. You can typically use a CI service integrated with your version control to automate this process. Examples of common CI services include CircleCI, GitHub CI, GitLab CI, Travis CI, and Semaphore. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\_integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) |
| requirements | the minimal set of software and library dependencies \(and their versions\) for a software project. [https://hackernoon.com/proper-software-requirements-101-32cf87e02a2f](https://hackernoon.com/proper-software-requirements-101-32cf87e02a2f) |
| repository | refers to a folder for a software project, commonly with a .git folder for version control [https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) |

| linting | analysis of source code for formatting and other language conventions. Linters can be run to validate, or can be used to automatically fix the file. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint) |
| pull request | putting your money where your mouth is and taking a shot at fixing an issue in a code base, and then opening a request for it's review to merge into the main \(usually master\) branch [https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) |
| IDE | means 'Integrated development environment,' and combines writing code, building and debugging into a single interface [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide) |
| TDD | means 'test-driven development', which is the idea of writing tests first then writing code that satisfies the tests [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven\_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) |
